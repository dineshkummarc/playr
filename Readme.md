## Playr ##

### Dependencies ###
* Rhythmbox
* [node.js](http://nodejs.org)
* [expressjs](http://expressjs.com)

### Usage ###

After installing node.js and expressjs, you need to put index.js (and supporting js, css, and img folders) in a place that you can access remotely. Note, that you **cannot** open index.html as a regular file. It must be served from a server.

Then from the /script folder, run `node playr.js` and you're good to go.

### TODOs ###

* Create a script to control starting/stopping playr
* Autocomplete search and play songs
* Volume controls
